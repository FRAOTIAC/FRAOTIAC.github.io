### ðŸ§  **About â€” Moments and Minds**

Welcome to *Moments and Minds* â€” a quiet space where technical depth meets emotional resonance, and fleeting thoughts find form in language.

I'm an AI systems engineer by trade, working on high-performance inference frameworks and optimization techniques. But beyond code and models, Iâ€™m endlessly curious about how we *think*, *feel*, and *exist* â€” and how those inner processes mirror the systems we build.

Here, I write about:
- the architecture of thought and consciousness,  
- the psychology of attention, avoidance, and perfectionism,  
- and the philosophies that help us navigate modern life with a little more clarity.

Sometimes you'll find notes on CUDA kernels or agent systems; other times, reflections on books, emotions, and growing through uncertainty.

This is my attempt to slow down time â€” to catch the moment before it fades, and to make sense of the mind before it moves on.
